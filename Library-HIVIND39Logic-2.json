No single HIV test can provide an HIV-positive diagnosis.\n * HIV.B.DE116: HIV-positive | Client is HIV-positive\n * HIV.B.DE117: HIV-negative | Client is HIV-negative\n * HIV.B.DE118: Unknown | Client has unknown HIV status\n * HIV.D.DE75: Current ART regimen | The current ART regimen the client is taking\n * HIV.E.DE46: Delivery date | Date on which the woman delivered\n * HIV.E.DE67: Place of delivery | The type of place where the woman delivered\n * HIV.E.DE68: Health facility | The woman delivered at a health facility\n * HIV.E.DE69: Home | The woman delivered at home\n * HIV.E.DE70: Other | The woman delivered at another location that is not at home or at a health facility\n * HIV.E.DE87: Infant date of birth | The infant's date of birth (DOB) if known\n * HIV.E.DE112: HIV-exposed infant or child | Whether the infant or child was determined to have had HIV exposure\n * HIV.E.DE229: Infant ART start date | The date on which the infant was started or restarted on antiretroviral therapy (ART)\n * HIV.SRV.DE20: HIV-exposed infant or child | Whether the infant or child was determined to have had HIV exposure\n *\n * Additional Context\n * - what it measures: This indicator measures the delivery of prevention services to HIV-exposed infants immediately after birth.\n * - rationale: • ARV prophylaxis for HIV-exposed infants is critical for reducing the risk of mother-to-child transmission in the immediate postpartum period – part of Prong 3 of the PMTCT strategy. | • In particular, coverage of HIV-exposed infants who are born in facilities should be very high. | • When using the programme-based/service delivery denominator, the indicator measures coverage among only HIV-exposed infants who are born in facilities, which is a direct measure of a programme's ability to meet standards of care.\n * - method: For the numerator: Programme records (for example, PMTCT registers) | a) For the programme-based/service delivery denominator: Programme records, labour and delivery registers | b) For the population-based denominator: Modelling-based estimates (for example, Spectrum AIM). |  | Note: The population-based denominator is a proxy measure for the number of infants born to HIV-infected women. |  | The recommended reporting period is 12 months.\n * \n * Suggested Scoring Method: proportion | http://hl7.org/fhir/us/cqfmeasures/StructureDefinition/proportion-measure-cqfm\n */\n\n","library HIVIND39Logic" ]
