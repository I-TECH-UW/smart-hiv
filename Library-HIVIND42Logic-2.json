Geneva: World Health Organization; 2022\n * \n * Data Concepts:\n * HIV.B.DE32: Breastfeeding | Infant is being breastfed by mother\n * HIV.D.DE32: Breastfeeding | Client is giving infant breast milk\n * HIV.E.DE87: Infant date of birth | The infant's date of birth (DOB) if known\n * HIV.E.DE112: HIV-exposed infant or child | Whether the infant or child was determined to have had HIV exposure\n * HIV.E.DE179: Registered in birth cohort | Whether the infant has been registered in a birth cohort\n * HIV.E.DE225: Infant HIV status | HIV status reported after applying the HIV testing algorithm. No single HIV test can provide an HIV-positive diagnosis.\n * HIV.E.DE226: HIV-positive | Infant is HIV-positive\n * HIV.E.DE227: HIV-negative | Infant is HIV-negative\n * HIV.E.DE228: Unknown | Infant has unknown HIV status\n * HIV.E.DE230: Final diagnosis of HIV-exposed infant | HIV-exposed infant final status at 18 months or 3 months after cessation of breastfeeding (whichever is later).\n * HIV.E.DE231: HIV-positive | The infant is HIV-positive\n * HIV.E.DE232: HIV-negative and no longer breastfeeding | The infant is HIV-negative and the mother has quit breastfeeding\n * HIV.E.DE233: HIV status unknown | The final HIV status of the child is unknown because the infant died, was lost to follow-up or transferred out without ever having an HIV-positive diagnosis or is active in care but was not tested at 18 months\n * HIV.SRV.DE20: HIV-exposed infant or child | Whether the infant or child was determined to have had HIV exposure\n * HIV.SRV.DE22: Final diagnosis of HIV-exposed infant | HIV-exposed infant final status at 18 months or 3 months after cessation of breastfeeding (whichever is later).\n *\n * Additional Context\n * - what it measures: This indicator measures quality of programme follow-up to track exposed infants and ascertain final HIV status.\n * - rationale: • Effective PMTCT programmes must follow HIV-exposed infants until the end of the breastfeeding period to ensure that the full cascade of services and support is provided to HIV-positive mothers and their infants. | • The ability to ascertain final outcome status through routine programme data across multiple points of care is a key challenge.\n * - method: This indicator measures quality of programme follow-up to track exposed infants and ascertain final HIV status.\n * \n * Suggested Scoring Method: proportion | http://hl7.org/fhir/us/cqfmeasures/StructureDefinition/proportion-measure-cqfm\n */\n\n","library HIVIND42Logic" ]
