No single HIV test can provide an HIV-positive diagnosis.\n * HIV.B.DE116: HIV-positive | Client is HIV-positive\n * HIV.B.DE117: HIV-negative | Client is HIV-negative\n * HIV.B.DE118: Unknown | Client has unknown HIV status\n * HIV.D.DE31: Currently pregnant | Client is currently pregnant\n * HIV.E.DE85: ANC contact date | The date and time of the client's ANC contact (in the ANC DAK this is called 'Contact date')\n * HIV.E.DE224: HIV test date | Date of the HIV test\n * HIV.SRV.DE1: HIV test date | Date of the HIV test\n * HIV.SRV.DE2: HIV test result | The result from HIV testing after applying the testing algorithm\n * HIV.SRV.DE7: Currently pregnant | Client is currently pregnant\n * HIV.SRV.DE18: ANC contact date | The date and time of the client's ANC contact (in the ANC DAK this is called 'Contact date')\n *\n * Additional Context\n * - what it measures: HIV prevalence among pregnant women attending ANC, including those who were diagnosed with HIV before their first ANC visit and those testing positive during their current pregnancy.\n * - rationale: HIV prevalence among ANC attendees is used for surveillance to measure HIV prevalence and incidence and to monitor trends in HIV infection when the following conditions are met to ensure that HIV prevalence among ANC clients is consistently representative of HIV prevalence among all pregnant women: | • ANC attendance is high and all women are recorded (for example, not missing large private-sector ANC services). | • HIV testing is offered to all pregnant women and not restricted to only higher-risk women or interrupted due to stock-outs of test kits. | • Only the first HIV test result is used to calculate HIV prevalence during a single pregnancy. | • Women who are already known to be HIV-positive and/or are already on ART prior to their first ANC visit during a pregnancy and, therefore, are not tested for HIV, are recorded | and included in routine reporting. All HIV-positive women must be included in both the numerator and denominator when calculating HIV prevalence among pregnant women. |  | See section 5.2 4 on WHO's 2022 HIV SI Guidelines on routine antenatal HIV testing for more detail. | This indicator is also useful for estimating the number of women in need of PMTCT services for programme planning purposes.\n * - method: ANC registers, patient monitoring tools, EMRs (for example, patient records). |  | The recommended reporting period is 12 months.\n * \n * Suggested Scoring Method: proportion | http://hl7.org/fhir/us/cqfmeasures/StructureDefinition/proportion-measure-cqfm\n */\n\n","library HIVIND43Logic" ]
