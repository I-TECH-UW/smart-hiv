Geneva: World Health Organization; 2022\n * \n * Data Concepts:\n * HIV.A.DE17: Age | Calculated age (number of years) of the client based on date of birth\n * HIV.B.DE32: Breastfeeding | Infant is being breastfed by mother\n * HIV.D.DE32: Breastfeeding | Client is giving infant breast milk\n * HIV.D.DE38: On ART | Client is currently taking ART\n * HIV.E.DE41: Timing of ART initiation | When the pregnant woman or mother initiated ART, for women living with HIV.\n * HIV.E.DE42: Already on ART at first antenatal care visit | The pregnant woman was already on antiretroviral therapy (ART) at first antenatal care visit\n * HIV.E.DE43: Newly on ART during pregnancy | The pregnant woman started ART during her pregnancy\n * HIV.E.DE44: Newly on ART during labour and delivery | The woman started ART during labour and delivery\n * HIV.E.DE46: Delivery date | Date on which the woman delivered\n * HIV.E.DE112: HIV-exposed infant or child | Whether the infant or child was determined to have had HIV exposure\n * HIV.E.DE173: Maternal and child health service visit | Maternal and child health service visit attended by an HIV-exposed infant\n * HIV.E.DE174: 12-month visit | HIV-exposed infant attending MCH services for a 12-month visit\n * HIV.E.DE175: 24-month visit | HIV-exposed infants attending MCH services for a 24-month visit\n * HIV.E.DE176: First visit after the end of breastfeeding | HIV-exposed infant attending MCH services for a first visit after the end of breastfeeding\n * HIV.H.DE47: On ART | Client is currently taking ART \n * HIV.SRV.DE20: HIV-exposed infant or child | Whether the infant or child was determined to have had HIV exposure\n *\n * Additional Context\n * - what it measures: This indicator measures the programme's ability to reduce the risk of transmission via breastfeeding (Prong 3 of the PMTCT strategy).\n * - rationale: • In many countries the average breastfeeding period is 18–24 months. The long breastfeeding period represents an important risk period for HIV-exposed infants. | • Ensuring that HIV-positive mothers are retained on ART, especially during the breastfeeding period, is critical to sustaining the health of the mother and preventing infection of her infant.\n * - method: For the numerator: Programme records (for example, PMTCT registers, ART registers). |  | For the denominator: Programme records (for example, MCH service records)\n * \n * Suggested Scoring Method: proportion | http://hl7.org/fhir/us/cqfmeasures/StructureDefinition/proportion-measure-cqfm\n */\n\n","library HIVIND41Logic" ]
