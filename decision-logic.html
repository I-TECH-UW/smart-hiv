<p>This page describes the decision support logic included in the WHO
Digital Adaptation Kit (DAK): SMART Guidelines for HIV Care.</p>

<p>The decision-support logic component provides the decision logic and
algorithms, as well as the scheduling of services, in accordance with
WHO guidelines. The decision logic and algorithms in this implementation
guide deconstruct the recommendations within the hiv guidelines
and guidance into a machine readable format that clearly labels the
inputs and outputs that would be operationalized in a digital
decision-support system, such as an electronic medical record
(EMR).</p>

<h1 id="decision-support-logic-overview">Decision Support Logic Overview</h1>
<p>The table below provides an overview of the decision-support tables and
algorithms for the different business processes in an EMR. The structure
of the decision-support tables is based on an adaptation of the Decision
Model and Notation (DMN™), an industry standard for modelling and
executing decision logic. These decision-support tables detail the
business rules, data inputs and outputs to support EMR business
processes.</p>

PrEP services provide a unique opportunity to screen for hepatitis B and hepatitis C infection and thus address multiple public health issues. Hepatitis B is endemic in some parts of the world where there is also a high burden of HIV. Testing oral PrEP users for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) once, at PrEP initiation, is preferred and has several advantages in these settings. Rapid point-of-care tests are available for HBsAg, and WHO has prequalified several rapid diagnostic tests. </td>

Recently diagnosed STIs are often indicators of risk of sexual acquisition of HIV. The predictive value of STI indicators
varies by region, the type of STI and a person&#x27;s demographic characteristics. A new diagnosis of syphilis or genital herpes
is a strong predictor of HIV risk among men who have sex with men in most settings and among heterosexual men and
women in areas of high HIV prevalence. PrEP services should be prioritized; local epidemiology will be essential to guide
decisions about when to offer PrEP and to which populations.</td>

Inconsistent use of condoms (male or female), including an intention to use condoms during sex with some occasional omissions or accidents, increases HIV risk. Social desirability bias in reporting condom use may occur, so PrEP could be considered for people reporting any intercourse without a condom or concerns about their future use of condoms. For example, someone who reports a desire to stop using condoms may be already having sex without condoms.</td>

If the person has had a recent high-risk HIV exposure (such as within the past 72 hours) they can be offered PEP and transition to PrEP after the completion of PEP and following additional HIV testing.

The following types of exposure may warrant HIV PEP.
• Body fluids: blood, blood-stained saliva, breast-milk, genital secretions; cerebrospinal, amniotic, peritoneal, synovial, pericardial or pleural fluids. Although these fluids carry a high risk of HIV infection, this list is not exhaustive. All cases should be assessed clinically, and the health care workers should decide whether the actual exposure constitutes a significant risk.
• Types of exposure: (1) mucous membrane from sexual exposure; splashes to the eye, nose, or oral cavity and (2) parenteral exposures.
Exposure that does not require HIV PEP includes:
• when the exposed individual is already HIV positive;
• when the source is established to be HIV negative; and
• exposure to bodily fluids that do not pose a significant risk: tears, non-blood-stained saliva, urine and sweat.

People may be subject to ongoing high risk of exposure to HIV, leading to multiple prescriptions for PEP. In such situations, health-care providers should discuss with their clients the potential benefits of transitioning to HIV PrEP.</td>

Measurement of kidney function will depend on age and comorbidities.  See Table 2. of source: Suggested procedures for measuring kidney function for TDF-containing oral PrEP

Measuring kidney function is optional for those aged under 30 years without kidney-related comorbidities.

Individuals aged 30 years and older without comorbidities may be screened once, at or within one to three months of oral PrEP initiation. Depending on available resources, this can be considered optional for those aged 30–49 years, particularly those aged 30–39, given the low risk of kidney impairment.

More frequent screening (every 6–12 months) is suggested for individuals with comorbidities, those aged 50 years and older, and those with a previous kidney function test result suggesting at least a mild reduction in function (eGFR &lt;90 mL/min per 1.73 m^2).

Waiting for kidney function test results should not delay initiation or continuation of oral PrEP.</td>
    <td>Reduced kidney function, indicated by a creatinine clearance of &lt;60 ml/min, is a contraindication for using oral PrEP containing TDF.  

More frequent screening than once is only suggested for individuals of any age with a history of comorbidities such as diabetes or hypertension, those 50 years or older and those who have had a previous creatinine clearance result of &lt;90 mL/min. For these oral PrEP users, a further test after the baseline screening and every 6–12 months thereafter can be considered. 

When creatinine screening is conducted, any individuals with an estimated creatinine clearance of ≥60 mL/min can safely be prescribed TDF-containing oral PrEP. Waiting for creatinine screening results should not delay starting oral PrEP, since the results can be reviewed at a follow-up visit. Abnormal creatinine clearance of &lt;60 mL/min should be repeated on a separate day before stopping TDF-containing oral PrEP. Other HIV prevention options should be discussed with the client.</td>

Note (from table 4.11, above): Current WHO clinical and immunological criteria have low sensitivity and positive predictive value for identifying individuals with virological failure. There is currently no proposed alternative definition of treatment failure and no validated alternative definition of immunological failure. Previous guidelines defined immunological failure based on a fall from baseline, which is no longer applicable in the context of CD4-independent treatment initiation. The option of CD4 cell count at 250 cells/mm3 following clinical failure is based on an analysis of data from Uganda and Zimbabwe.
