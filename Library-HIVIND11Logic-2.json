Measured at either the service provider or population level.\n * - rationale: By providing a direct method of reducing the number of injection risk acts per person who inject drugs, OAMT is a critical component of effective harm reduction services.\n * - method: Individual-level data obtained from programme records. |  | The total population of people who are opioid dependent includes both people who inject drugs as well as people who consume opioids by other routes of administration. Not all OAMT recipients will have a history of injecting and not all people who inject drugs will use or be dependent on opioids.\n * \n * Suggested Scoring Method: proportion | http://hl7.org/fhir/us/cqfmeasures/StructureDefinition/proportion-measure-cqfm\n */\n\n","library HIVIND11Logic" ]
